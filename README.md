# CapillaDiff
CapillaDiff is a latent diffusion model (LDM) adapted for generating high-resolution synthetic nailfold capillaroscopy (NFC) images to support systemic sclerosis (SSc) research through realistic, label-conditioned vascular image synthesis. Based on the MorphoDiff framework (Navidi et al., ICLR 2025).
